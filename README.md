# Batleships

This game takes the original board game battleships, based inside a mock terminal deployed via Heroku.

As a child of the 90's, I used the traditional ship naming conventions from the 1990 Milton Bradley game version over the more modern Hasbro rendition. One can find more info on the rules, and the history of the game here on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)
